# Dynamic DNS clients for FreeDNS and DuckDNS
Client IP update utilities for [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org "FreeDNS")
and [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org "DuckDNS") written using Python 3
without any external libraries. If you have `python3` and an Internet
connection these should run on your host/device.

## Installation
Run them from the repo or copy them anywhere you want. Both utilities
are standalone and may be copied separately.

## Usage
Use `--help` with the utilities for details. Because of slightly differing
APIs the command line arguments for both are a bit different.
